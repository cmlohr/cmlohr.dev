                    Who am I?
                  </h2>
                  <p class="bio">
                    My name is Colleen Lohr, I'm a software engineer and I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana. &nbsp;Like many of my peers, I grew up with the internet, developed an early obsession with technology and began playing with code as a young teenager. &nbsp;By the early-2000's I started taking on frontend design and coding freelance jobs.
                    <br><br>

                    The Beginning
                  </h2>
                  <p class="bio">
                    In 2004 I started working in data entry and by the following year I started leveraging my knowledge of HTML and CSS knowledge to begin freelancing. &nbsp;As a young woman in her twenties, I began attending computer science courses at Tulane University. &nbsp;Working under the encouragement of my professor's I became interested in automation and systems architecture.
                    <br><br>

                    Cryptocurrency
                  </h2>
                  <p class="bio">
                    Then cryptocurrency began to take off, and I was on the rocket. &nbsp;I was initially drawn into the field by the utilization of blockchain technology. &nbsp;My work in FinTech began in the front end with marketing, design and user experiance specialites.
                    <br><br>
                    Then as my enthusiasim for the space grew I worked my way into backend development. &nbsp;Working directly with the code, I helped develop genesis blocks, support backends and build wallets. &nbsp;Most of our projects were deployed into Linux cloud servers and managed remotly. &nbsp;Intensely curious about the possibilities of blockchain technology, I began researching projects of my own, one of which I still work on sporadically today.

                    Management
                  </h2>
                  <p class="bio">
                    In 2018 I transitioned out of a direct development position into managing projects. &nbsp;As a manager, I planned the logistics of sourcing remote employees, funding, design and code. &nbsp;I left this arena in 4Q 2019 to pursue frontend freelancing to focus on other projects.

                    Covid
                  </h2>
                  <p class="bio">
                    2020 brought new and unprecedented challenges for me as it did for everyone. &nbsp;However, I found a silver lining in these grim times and saw unique opportunities for personal growth. &nbsp;I pivoted to full-time freelancing, started my own company, project building and education early in 2020. &nbsp;Under Covid mitigation measures I've been able to expand my knowledge base into WordPress and it's allowed me to explore new passions, such as machine learning and data science.<br><br>

                    Giving Back
                  </h2>
                  <p class="bio">
                    Like many in tech I too have greatly benifited from those who came before. &nbsp;So when I'm not helping clients with their vision, I'm helping guide and tutor new developers to hone their skills and pick up new tricks.
                    <br><br>
                    To work towards those aims I've created an online community of like-minded new developers where we work together with an emphasis on learning together and from each other. &nbsp;The primary focus of the community is to assist anyone who wants to further their understanding of fullstack development and data science.

                  <p class="bio">
                    I love how is code is mathematics come to life. &nbsp;To me it's the closest we'll ever get to actual magic because it allows us to create our own digital realities and test the limits of technology.
                    <br><br>
      
                    When I'm not coding, which is honestly a rare these days, I like to unwind by getting into nature. &nbsp;I'm either getting dirty in the garden, getting lost in a book or preparing a fantastically spicy batch of crawfish.<br><br>

                  <p id="explainer">*Lagniappe is pronounced <a id="lagniappe" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqY_KQaqAY4" target="_blank">'lan·yap'</a> and is New Orleans speak for 'a little extra'.
